A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/scottb/pen/javhr.

 This is a navigation menu that responsively goes off canvas, similar to an app style menu. A version of this menu is used in the m1 WordPress theme: http://wordpress.org/themes/m1

This is a simplified version based on David Bushell's article: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/15/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/
